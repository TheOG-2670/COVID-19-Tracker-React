# Covid-19 Tracker

This React web app extracts statistical data via an API endpoint from different countries and displays the number of active cases, recoveries and deaths that those countries report. Currently, Global, Canadian, American, Sri Lankan, and Israeli cases, deaths and recoveries are displayed with the intention to display other countries with more upcoming updates.

**Note**: This is a work-in-progress


Credits go to **Mathdroid** for developing the API endpoint.
