# Covid-19 Tracker React App

This React web app displays statistical data via a custom-built NodeJS API back-end which accesses an external API that aggregates data from John Hopkins University for different countries and displays the number of active cases, recoveries and deaths from those countries. The app has been updated to display global and country-specific data.

**Note**: This is still a work-in-progress with more features to be added in the near future


Credits go to **Disease.sh** for developing the API endpoint: https://github.com/disease-sh/api
