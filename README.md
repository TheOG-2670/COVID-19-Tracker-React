# Covid-19 Tracker

This React web app extracts statistical data via an API endpoint from different countries and displays the number of active cases, recoveries and deaths that those countries report. Currently, Global, Canadian and American cases, deaths and recoveries are displayed with the intention to display other countries in the near future.

**Note**: This is a work-in-progress
